# slimv fork â€” DEPRECATED

This is a fork of [slimv](https://github.com/kovisoft/slimv), a Vim plugin for
editing Lisp, Scheme and Clojure files. 

This fork contains a number of fixes to an old version of slimv, to make it work
under under macOS or any platform that uses BSD netcat instead of GNU netcat.
This code is deprecated and unmaintained, and is only kept for archival purposes
in relation to [this StackOverflow response](http://stackoverflow.com/a/14910735/1121837). For the latest version of slimv, please check the link above.
